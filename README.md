# Ansible role: etcd

This role configures etcd and etcdctl on your target host. It supports all etcd configuration options and strives to be as flexible as possible.

## Requirements

This role developed and tested with following Ansible versions:

| Name                                                   | Version         |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible-base/)      | ```>= 2.9.13``` |
| [ansible-base](https://pypi.org/project/ansible-base/) | ```>= 2.10.1``` |

Other Ansible versions was not tested but will probably work.

## Installation

Use ```ansible-galaxy install igor_nikiforov.etcd``` to install the latest stable release of role.

You could also install it from requirements ```ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml```:

```yaml
# requirements.yml
---
roles:
  - name: igor_nikiforov.etcd
    version: v1.0.0
```

## Platforms

| Name   | Version             |
|--------|---------------------|
| Debian | ```buster, bullseye```        |
| Ubuntu | ```focal, jammy``` |
| CentOS | ```7.4+, stream8```       |
| RedHat | ```7.4+, 8```       |

Other OS distributions was not tested but will probably work. In case if not please raise a PR!

## Usage

Role supports all etcd configuration parameters which could be passed via ```etcd_config``` variable. You could find example of YAML config format in [etcd official repository](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/etcd.conf.yml.sample) and all availible flags with discription in [etcd official documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/op-guide/configuration/).

etcd supports two main methods to build a cluster:

1. [Static.](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/op-guide/clustering/#static)

   After playbook execution you should manually add each member from one of host using ```etcdctl member add``` command. It supposing that you will do this manually or automate in separate Ansible task.

2. [DNS discovery.](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/op-guide/clustering/#dns-discovery)

   Main prerequisite here is to have ready SRV and A records in your DNS local zone. Please carefully check [requirements for DNS records](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/op-guide/clustering/#create-dns-srv-records) which should be created in advance. If everything created properly following DNS discovery related properties needs to be added to ```etcd_config```:
   ```yaml
   etcd_config:
     discovery-srv: "company.local"
     discovery-srv-name: "dev" # optional
   ```
   After playbook execution etcd cluster will be automatically created. It is strongly recommended to use this method in production.

Important:
- Don't forget to change ```etcd_config.initial-cluster-state``` from ```new``` to ```existing``` in playbook after first execution.
- Use ```serial: 1``` in your playbook after you build a cluster to safely update it in case of configuration change. More info [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.html).
